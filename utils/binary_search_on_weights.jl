"""
Perform binary search on a single weight while keeping others fixed.
Creates directories and saves results for each iteration.

Parameters:
- weight_name: Symbol indicating which weight to search (:supervised, :bc, or :pde)
- weight_range: Tuple (min, max) defining the search range
- num_iterations: Number of binary search iterations to perform
- fixed_weights: NamedTuple with the fixed values for the other weights
